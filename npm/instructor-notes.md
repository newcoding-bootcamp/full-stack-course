# npm

Node's package manager npm is the largest ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.

npmjs.org

package: previously we would bring in code via a <link> or <script> tag

On servers, there is no HTML, so we can't use <link> or <script> tags, so we use packages instead.

All packages are centralized here on this website

npm has a command-line tool that makes installation easy, no need to copy-paste, or find a CDN
